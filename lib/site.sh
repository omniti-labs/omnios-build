# These two should be uncommented and set to specific git changeset IDs
# if illumos-kvm and illumos-kvm-cmd get too far ahead of illumos-{gate,omnios}.
# NOTE -> These two values reflect the current known-to-work revisions.
# If a revision matches tip, you don't need to uncomment it.  If it is behind
# tip, you MUST uncomment it, or KVM/KVM-cmd won't build.
