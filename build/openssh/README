As of 11 February 2016, the OpenSSH build for OmniOS should be a nearly if not
entirely FULL replacement for the old SunSSH 1.5 in illumos-{gate,omnios}.

The README from Joyent's efforts here follow the separator line.  As you read
them, also remember:

- All patches prefixed with numbers come from elsewhere.  All without come
  from OmniOS sources.

- Joyent's 1002-sunw_ssl.patch isn't included, because we package more modern
  OpenSSL implementations than what used to be in illumos-gate or other distros'
  OpenSSL.

- Joyent's 0026-Make-default-sshd_config-more-like-the-old-illumos-o.patch
  is also not included, because we already patched sshd_config per our own
  specs.  If 0026 is deemed includeable, sshd_config.patch should go away, or
  be renamed to 0026... if it's deemed by the greater illumos community as a
  better replacement, or basis thereof.

- Joyent's 0033-Temporarily-set-ssh-keygen-and-ssh-add-to-old-FP-for.patch is
  not included, because it's specific to Joyent's SDC.

=============================================================

This is a note to future maintainers about the patches for OpenSSH in this
directory.

# General notes

The mission when creating this patchset was to preserve enough of SunSSH's
behaviour and features to avoid serious problems for users upgrading to it from
SunSSH 1.5.

In particular, the PAM and RBAC behaviour of SunSSH had to be preserved, so that
login into roles, reduced privileges at login, and other features specific to
Illumos work correctly. The reason these don't work on stock upstream OpenSSH is
due to differences between our PAM and other PAM implementations -- openssh-
portable's PAM support is written primarily against Linux-PAM and OpenPAM.

Another key requirement was that stock SunSSH config files have to work
unmodified on the new replacement sshd, to avoid users being locked out by an
SSH daemon that can no longer start. SmartOS is a live distro, and has no
ability to "migrate" or "upgrade" user configuration files during a change of
version, so the SSH daemon has to be able to start using an old config file.

PAM and configuration compatibility account for about half the patches applied
by count. The rest include some forward-ported features such as GSSAPI KeyEx
support, auditing changes, PubKeyPlugins, and use of privileges(5).

The patch files usually have some text in their commit messages (they are
serialised git commits) explaining their purpose and scope, which can be useful
to help understand things.

As an unfortunate side note, diff'ing SunSSH itself against OpenSSH is basically
impossible because of its hodge-podge merge history that has never been
publically released. Doing line-by-line comparisons to verify compatibility is
thus very challenging.

# Updating OpenSSH

Reconstitute the patches in the Patches/ directory into a git repo,
based on the tag in https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable that
matches up with that version. (Use git am for this)

Then you should be able to rebase onto a newer tag, merging as
needed.

The tarball in this directory is a clean checkout of the OpenSSH-portable
source without its configure script or any generated files. The
patches should only ever modify configure.ac and not configure, since
the Makefile here will regenerate configure using autoreconf.

# Patches for upstreaming

Patches #21 and #29 relate to dropping Illumos privileges, and can probably be
eventually upstreamed (in a form modified to have some more `#ifdef`s, maybe a
`configure` arg).

Patches #22 and maybe a cleaned up version of #28 would also make decent
candidates for upstreaming.

# Patches to be dropped eventually

The #33 patch, which sets `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-add` to the old fingerprint
behaviour should be eventually dropped once we're assured of not breaking
SDC users. HEAD-2257 is probably relevant.

#26 should be droppable once we figure out if we can move ssh keys back to
`/etc/ssh`, like the rest of the known world.

Eventually, #31 will be droppable, but this is not likely until circa 2018 or
so, once we're fairly confident there aren't SunSSH clients left in the wild
that we care about.
